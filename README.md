# Small in Browser raw wireframe render with canvas only

I was inspired by Tsoding when he created own graphic API with canvas only and 
I decided to append `.stl` render in this tinr API with small _Elm_ module that parse `.stl` file and load into API. I think that  functional languages incredibly good for data parsing (in out case just plain ASCII text).
